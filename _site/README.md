# ImAlex - Alex Imbrea presentation website.

## Targets

The main purpose of this website is to create a personal portfolio to show my work and a little part from my personality to the audience.

A second target is to learn more web high-end technologies that are used at the moment in industry. Also User Experience and User Interaction will be an important part for this project.

## Tools
 - KitKraken:
 - `Atom`:
 - [Trello]()
 - '[][]'

## Technologies

1. 'Jekyll': the most important reason why this website is hosted on [GitHub] is the fact that GitHub Pages use, deploy and run Jekyll websites by default.
2. 'SCSS':
3. 'CoffeScript':

## Progress

[] Find a domain name: imalex.me for free using the GitHub Educational Pack voucher.
[] Find a hosting provider: GitHub because it can run Jekyll natively.
[] Think about the structure of the website.
[] Learn more about new web technologies.
