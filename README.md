# ImAlex - Alex Imbrea presentation website.

## Targets

The main purpose of this website is to create a personal portfolio to show my work and a little part from my personality to the audience.

A second target is to learn more web high-end technologies that are used at the moment in industry. Also User Experience and User Interaction will be an important part for this project.

## Tools
 - [KitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/): A good GUI Git client that works perfect in Ubuntu.
 - [Atom](atom.io): The best text editor with a lot of Git integrations and plug-ins available.
 - [Trello](https://trello.com): A powerful tool for planning my work.

## Technologies

1. 'Jekyll': the most important reason why this website is hosted on [GitHub] is the fact that GitHub Pages use, deploy and run Jekyll websites by default.
2. 'SCSS': I knew CSS for years but SASS seems to be more powerful.
3. 'CoffeScript': A new wave of scripting language supported natively by Jekyll.

## Progress

- [x] Find a domain name: imalex.me for free using the GitHub Educational Pack voucher.
- [x] Find a hosting provider: GitHub because it can run Jekyll natively.
